### Assessment of Values
Throughout the pursuance of my Computer Science degree in an online-only learning environment, I have honed my **_self-motivation and attention to detail_**, which is evidenced by my **_3.98 GPA_**. Throughout this time and the past 7.5 years, I have been working full time to support my family which has required a great deal of **_dedication_** and no small amount of sacrifice to achieve my educational goals. My combined experiences have taught me that **_professionalism, communication, respect, honesty, and quality_** are among the greatest assets a company can have in an employee, and I strongly believe I have cultivated these qualities to great effect. 

### Assessment of Skills and Knowledge
Within Computer Science and specifically the development of this portfolio, I have practiced **_version control_** to keep projects organized and maintain efficient team collaboration. I have demonstrated mastery over the fundamentals of:

- **data structures and algorithms** to handle computations in an efficient, stable, and safe manner

- **software engineering** including good design decisions with the long term kept foremost in mind

- **software architecture** to ensure smooth intuitive development

- **database operations** that are clean and effective

- **general security** to keep people and data safe and prevent undefined behavior.



### Introduction to Artifacts and Examples
In my Mobile Architecture & Programming class I solely developed a simple Android application using Java and XML to manage an inventory. For this portfolio I have enhanced and iterated on this fully functional application to demonstrate my competency and abilities in various categories which are: code reviews to evaluate current code conditions and identify improvements, software engineering and design through implementing a new way to interact with the inventory items, data structures and algorithms through a sorting function and database operations by implementing tagging and filtering system.

### CODE REVIEW

Below is a code review I conducted of my own project. I cover how the Inventory app functions, the code associated with it, and some planned enhancements and improvements.
