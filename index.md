### PROFESSIONAL SELF-ASSESSMENT
#### Values
Throughout the pursuance of my Computer Science degree in an online-only learning environment, I have honed my self-motivation and attention to detail, which is evidenced by my **3.98 GPA**. Throughout this time and the past 7.5 years, I have been working full time to support my family which has required a great deal of **dedication** and no small amount of **sacrifice** to achieve my educational goals. My combined experiences have taught me that **professionalism, communication, respect, honesty, and quality** are among the greatest assets a company can have in an employee, and I strongly believe I have cultivated these qualities to great effect. 

#### Skills and Knowledge
Within Computer Science and specifically the development of this portfolio, I have practiced **version control** to keep projects organized and maintain efficient team collaboration. I have demonstrated mastery over the fundamentals of **data structures and algorithms** to handle computations in an efficient, stable, and safe manner, **software engineering** including good design decisions with the long term kept foremost in mind, **software architecture** to ensure smooth intuitive development, **database operations** that are clean and effective, and general **security** to keep people and data safe and prevent undefined behavior.

#### Artifacts and Examples
In my Mobile Architecture & Programming class I solely developed simple Android application using Java and XML to manage an inventory. For this portfolio I have enhanced and iterated on this fully functional application to demonstrate my competency and abilities in various categories which are: code reviews to evaluate current code conditions and identify improvements, software engineering and design through implementing a new way to interact with the inventory items, data structures and algorithms through a sorting function and database operations by implementing tagging and filtering system.



### CODE REVIEW

Below is a code review I conducted of my own project. I cover how the Inventory app functions, the code associated with it, and some planned enhancements and improvements.
